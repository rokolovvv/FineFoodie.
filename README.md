This HTML project, **FineFoodie**, is designed as a promotional webpage for a nutrition and diet consultancy service. It aims to showcase subscription options, diet types, and key team members, providing users with an inviting and accessible layout to explore and subscribe to different plans. I was just training my Html and Css/Scss knowledge, so i made it without finctionality.

### Key Features and Technologies Used:

- **Header and Footer**: Consistent navigation elements include a logo, site title, and links to different pages, giving users easy access to various sections.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and includes `meta` tags for mobile optimization, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across devices.
- **SVG Icons**: SVGs are used for the logo, giving it a modern, scalable appearance.
- **Sections**:
  - **Contact Section**: Highlights the brandâ€™s motto, inviting users to connect with a specialist for personalized dietary advice.
  - **Subscription Plans**: Describes weekly, monthly, and yearly diet plans with features such as specialist support, diet creation, and application access.
  - **Diet Types**: Briefly explains popular diet types (e.g., low-calorie, low-carbohydrate diets), making it easy for users to explore options.
  - **User Section**: A mock-up user table with avatars, contact information, and department status simulates team member profiles, adding a professional touch.
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags (`description`, `keywords`) are used to improve the page's discoverability.
- **CSS Styling**: Linked via `style.css`, custom CSS styles are applied to enhance the visual appeal and usability of each section.

The overall design provides users with clear navigation and structured content, making it an effective platform for promoting a food and diet service.
